  My first (ever) expensive meal at a fancy restaurant. I thought the reviewers on Google Maps were kidding with the $100/person estimate.

# A Fancy Meal

<script setup lang="ts">

During my transition to O'ahu, 
my work will be paying for my meals and lodging up to a certain amount,
so I decided to try and splurge a few nights
(after this experience, I've found I don't have the stomach for food this rich every day),
particularly on meals. 
There's a really fancy steak and seafood restaurant on the top floor of my hotel,
so I popped up to try it out.

(I got an appetizer, but it was just some bread. 
Probably expensive bread, but it was just okay, slightly burnt.)
Inspired by the words of a former coworker, I ordered their signature Mai Tai.

## Entrée: 12 oz. Greek-style filet mignon 

Being a steakhouse, I decided to get a steak
(well, I could've also gotten the full lobster,
but there was no way I was finishing that). 
The 10 oz. Wagyu was a bit out of my price budget,
but the 12 oz. Greek-style filet mignon was not
(Greek-style here just being a balsamic vinegar-based sauce drizzled on top).

On my first bite, it was very good. 
Probably the tenderest steak I've ever had.
All the way through about 2/3rds of the steak,
it was very good,
After that, I could start to feel the richness of the sauce,
and only one thought dominated my mind: MUST FINISH.
EVERY BITE IS LIKE $5!

## Dessert: Yuzu-flavored sorbet

Even though I was already pretty full, 
I also got a dessert: Yuzu (citrus) flavored sorbet,
thinking it would be a good palette cleanser.

# First Impressions in Hawaii

I've been waiting since about two weeks after I got here
to write something like this about my first thoughts about Hawaii and life here,
beyond just the very initial impressions during my first few days here adjusting.
But I never got something complete, 
only little snippets of things I wanted to talk about, voice recordings, and
especially about struggles that I had been going through 
during what was my first few weeks, which became first month, first two months, and now 2.5 months.

So it's a little weird.
This is my "first impressions" post, almost 3 months into the 12 months that I'll be here,
only now writing out and publishing this post about my "first" impressions.
So. Here are my first impressions, feelings, and status of my life in Hawaii thus far.

So even though it's been a long time (temporally),
there are kind of good reasons for it taking so long.

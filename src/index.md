    <p class="title">Hey there!</p>
    <p class="subtitle">
      I'm a computer science researcher in machine learning and research software engineer.
      I also do some work with graph analytics and visualization.
      I'm interested in why and when deep learning works (its inductive biases),
      empirically investigating curious properties of neural networks, and
      effective visual analytics for data.

## What I'm Currently Working on

- a few machine learning research projects
- a visual analytic tool for interactively working with digitized maps
- a system for tracking one's learning progress in Chinese and annotating documents with contextual information

## What I've Worked on in the Past

- open source suite of (partially complete) packages in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) for working with
  the Chinese language (hosted under the JuliaCJK group in GitHub):
    - [ZhuyinPinyin.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/ZhuyinPinyin.jl)
    - [CEDICT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/CEDICT.jl),
    - [CJKFrequencies.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/CJKFrequencies.jl), and
    - [IDSGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/IDSGraphs.jl),
    - which were intended to be combined in [UnifiedChineseDictionary.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCJK/UnifiedChineseDictionary.jl).
- benchmark for deep learning-based approaches to learning over tabular datasets
